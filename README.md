# IRCPrinter

Something something lets print to irc because reasons.

# Install
``` bash
# Build
make

# Install
sudo make install
sudo make add-printer

# Configure
sudo $EDITOR /etc/default/ircprinter
```

# Usage

Just print some thing in postscript to the printer IRCPRINTER, but make sure you set the settings in `/etc/default/ircprinter` before.

Currently, there is no support for multiple connections or something more dynamic.

Maybe there never will be.

Well, maybe *someone* will PR it in ;)
